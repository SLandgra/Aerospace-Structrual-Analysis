# Aerospace-Structrual-Analysis
UCSD SE 160A Programming assignments with sample inputs/outputs.

## Running this code:  
Each MatLab file (`.m` files) take in an input excel file and return an output excel file.  
MatLab files are run using the MatLab program.  

## Naming Convention:  
Each file was named to be able to be turned into the SE160A class. The files and description of what they do are follows:  

 *  Cros-Section Properties - SE160A_1_Landgraf_Steven

 *  Loads - SE160A_2_Landgraf_Steven

 *  Stress and Failure Theories - SE160A_3_Landgraf_Steven

 *  Composite Analysis - SE160A_4_Landgraf_Steven

 *  Combined Wing Bending/Twist/Shear - SE160A_5_Landgraf_Steven
 
 ## Excel Files:
 The excel files inside this repo are I/O examples. If a user does not have MatLab these files are to demonstrate the use cases for these MatLab Files.
